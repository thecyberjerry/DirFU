********************Notes from Developer[Must Read]********************

1. This is a simple one level Directory Bruteforcer or Fuzzer tool.
2. It is based on the same logic that our SUBLI Tool is made.
3. We did some fine changes to the logical code of SUBLI and produced this Bruteforcer.
4. It will provide you with directory fuzzing output with status code of directory.
5. Give it a path to wordlist and it will enumerate for Directories for you.
6. Please provide [-d] input in the form of : example.com,google.com,bing.com.
7. Please provide [-f] input in the form of : /path/to/file/file.txt
8. You can change request method to POST if wanted but this is not eligible for HTTP body params it is only for testing

#Usage:
`python3 dirfu.py -d example.com -f /file.txt [-p]`
